# --- Data Handling & Manipulation ---
# Pinning NumPy to a version < 2.0 to ensure compatibility with shap release` is definitive. The version of `shap` (0.45.0) that I recommended, while solving the previous `llvmlite` problem, is itself incompatible with the newest versions of NumPy (2.0 and later==0.45.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy<2.0

# --- Visualization & Plotting ---
plotly>=5.15.0
matplotlib>=3.7.0

# --- Statistical Analysis & Modeling ---
# Required for the "Statistical Workbench" tab
scipy>=1.10.0
statsmodels>=0.14.0

# --- Machine Learning & Explainability ---
# Required for the "ML & Bioinformatics Lab). The code inside `shap` is calling a function that no longer exists in NumPy 2.0.

This is a classic and difficult dependency hell problem. It's not a syntax error in my generated code, but a fundamental"
# Pinned to a known stable version compatible with Python 3.11 and NumPy < 2.0
scikit-learn>=1.3.0
shap==0.45.0
